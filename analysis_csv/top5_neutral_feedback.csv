48,A26AY1TFK8BQXQ,3,Mushy,"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy."
50,A276999Y6VRSCQ,3,"Same stuff","This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste."

61,A1ZR8O62VSU4OK,3,"Better price for this at Target","Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target."
